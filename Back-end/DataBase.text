************** Mongo DB , SQL and MySQl
Today I learn about the Mongo DB which is different from the SQL or MySQL databases .
Mongo DB is used for non relational data meanwhile for relational data we se MySQL. In Mongo DB data is stored in the form of objects like in JS , data in form of documentation on the file and then stored in the folder which provides more flexibility , easy to share anywhere , fast accessing data , server managment also can be accurate by using mongo DB.
